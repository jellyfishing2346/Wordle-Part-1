# Wordle-Part-1

In your first project, you will complete a partially finished version of the popular game Wordle. If you need to become more familiar with the game, please play at least one round to understand how Wordle works. In each round, you will be given a secret word to guess and a limited number of chances to do so. With each guess, you'll receive clues that indicate which letters are included in the word and where they're located. You aim to use these clues to guess the secret word before running out of attempts.
